I am an old timer, started programming in the 1970's on an IBM 360 at Community College! I ran a punchcard reader as workstudy at University, had a summer job programming in COBOL, and started in BASIC and FORTRAN IV!
College used PASCAL, and post-college used Pascal and JOVIAL for system design.  Built a Unix-clone for the military (early 80s)
Later moved designing and building embedded systems. Mostly asm for Mil-Std 1750A.  Moved on to OOD using C, C++, Jscript, HTML, X Windowx, 
Worked for NASA using Ada and other languages to design spacecraft embedded systems  Picked up some Perl,Java, XML, VB Basic and other languages along the way  

Used various code management programs including Unix, Linux, and other systems   
Started learning AI in early 80s in grad school with teachers well known in the field
